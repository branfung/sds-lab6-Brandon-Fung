        <p><strong>TODO:</strong> Create a results.html page that is rendered when the /results route is used in app.py.
            Use Jinja templating to include the output of the function in model.py as part of the results.html page.

            In app.py, use render_template to send the user to results.html when the form has been filled out (POST request).
            Make sure to display to the user which answers are correct and which answers are wrong.
            If the form has not been completed (GET request), return a string explaining that they need to go back to the form.</p>
